Object Oriented Programming

Types of programming

1)Procedural

2)OO(Object Oriented)

Object Wrappers:

-   It is object oriented code that includes other code

-   Can take both structural and functionality features(security
    features) wrap inside wrappers

| OO                                | Procedural                        |
+===================================+===================================+
| attributes and behaviours are     | attributes and behaviours are     |
| contained within single object    | normally separated                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Data integrity problem is easily  | **Data Integrity**:               |
| solved in OO                      |                                   |
|                                   | Sometimes global data also        |
|                                   | present so chance of modification |
|                                   | is easy                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Access to data is uncontrollable  |
|                                   | and unpredictable (because        |
|                                   | multiple function has access to   |
|                                   | global data)                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Encapsulation- data and methods   |                                   |
| are combined together into object |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Data hiding-\> combining          |                                   |
| attributes and method in same     |                                   |
| entity (Object) -\> we can        |                                   |
| control access to                 |                                   |
| data(restricting certain          |                                   |
| attributes/method)                |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Both Data and operations are      | Transport over n/w code wont send |
| encapsulated into obj and send    | through n/w                       |
| over n/w                          |                                   |
|                                   | Data of system is separated from  |
| Ex:web object (browser has no     | operations                        |
| idea what a web obj will do but   |                                   |
| when obj is loaded browser        |                                   |
| executes the code with obj and    |                                   |
| uses data contained within obj)   |                                   |
